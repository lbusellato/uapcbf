# Uncertainty Aware-Predictive Control Barrier Functions: Safer Human Robot Interaction through Probabilistic Motion Forecasting

This repository contains the code for the UAPCBF project. The project deals with safe interaction between robot and human in the context of a collaborative cell. This includes:

* Tracking the position of the operator's hand through a Leap Motion v2 camera
* Forecasting the future position of the operator's hand through a deep-learning module
* Safely planning the trajectory of the robot's end-effector through a custom Control Barrier Function formulation

The framework and its applications are detailed in a paper: TBD
